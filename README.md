# Orbiter
Simple - lightweight program to manage orbites and orbital trajectories.

UNDER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT - first release on 21.03.23!



To add:\n
-define orbit in 3d \n
-up to 10 objects on different orbit \n 
-Parameters: orbital speed, apoapsis, periapsis, orbital period, time do apoapsis/periapsis, inclination, eccentricity, nodes \n 
-manevuer assist: edit orbit by pro/retro gradin, nml, rad - KSP Style \n 
-add 2 views - side & top - a'la Space Shuttle navigation system \n 
-Include Einstein's relativity delay (a'la GPS) when communicating
-Implement current position with rotating - GRAD, NML, RAD
-implement simple algorithm for reentry burn
-add navball
-add simulated input from 3 sensors & voting while outbound/malfunction

LOT OF WORK TO DO!!!!
